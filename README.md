# B-plus-plus
# B++ is a low level language built with inspiration from languages such as C/C++, Rust and Zig. B++ will support type inference similar to C++ and we plan to introduce memory safety on the compiler level using checks during compilation like the borrow checker in Rust but with a built in statement that the developer can use to disregard safeguards so you don't have to spend all your time battling the compiler. Control and speed are the two things that are most important to us so we want to make sure that there is as little overhead during runtime as possible.
# We look forward to updating you about B++
