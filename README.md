# B-plus-plus
# B++ is a low level language that is roughly inspired by the B language. Some original B code may work in B++ but rules and syntax will often seem more similar to languages like C or Zig. B++ will support type inference using the 'auto' keyword from B and C++. We hope to introduce memory safety on the compiler level using checks during compilation. Control and speed are the two things that are most important to us so we want to make sure that there is as little overhead during runtime as possible.
# We look forward to updating you about B++
